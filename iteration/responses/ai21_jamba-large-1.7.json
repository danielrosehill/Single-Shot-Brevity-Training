  "prompt": "I own a One Plus Nord 3 5G.\n\nI need to pick up a power bank. This power bank would not be used for travel so forget airline limits.\n\nHere, instead, is the combination I'm looking for:\n\n- Charges the phone as quickly as possible. One Plus supports SuperVOOC so ... something that gets as close to the max this can deliver as possible (assuming the right cables, etc; whatever to ensure that the power bank itself is not a constraint)\n\n- As large a capacity as is credible. Disreputable manufacturers often make wild and barely feasible claims about the capacity of their power banks. I want to purchase something that achieves what it says. I want the largest power bank that I can purchase while staying within the portable power bank form factor (ie, something that can be slotted into a backpack). This does not need to be pocket sized. \n\nPlease provide these answers:\n\n1: Tech spec: what am I looking for? What parameters do I need?\n\n2: What's the max capacity, approximately, think is credible.\n\n3: Manufacturers and product names: give me 5 good options each with an RRP. Be specific (manufacturer, PN).",
  "response": "Here\u2019s what you should look for when picking a power bank for your One Plus Nord 3 5G:\n\n### **Tech Specs to Consider:**\n\n1. **Output Power:** Ensure the power bank supports One Plus's SuperVOOC fast charging, which typically requires **65W or more output**. Check if the power bank has Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 and/or supports proprietary fast-charging standards.\n2. **Capacity:** A larger capacity means more charges. Look for **20,000mAh to 40,000mAh**\u2014higher capacities exist but may be bulkier.\n3. **Cable Support:** Use a Type-C to Type-C cable rated for high-speed charging. Confirm that the power bank supports the **9V/3A, 12V/5A, or 20V/3.25A profiles** for maximum compatibility.\n4. **Input Recharging Speed:** Check the time it takes to recharge the power bank. PD-enabled power banks often recharge in **1\u20132 hours** with appropriate chargers.\n\n### **Maximum Credible Capacity:**\n\nA **40,000mAh power bank** is realistic in the portable form factor. Some brands market higher capacities, but those push the limits of usability or veracity.\n\n### **Top 5 Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore 24K (24,000mAh)**\n\t- **Output:** 140W max (supports PD 3.0, PPS).\n\t- **Capacity:** 24,000mAh (8\u201310 charges for Nord 3).\n\t- **Price:** \u20b912,000 approx.\n2. **Baseus Power Bank 65W (30,000mAh)**\n\t- **Output:** 65W max, dual Type-C PD, supports SuperVOOC.\n\t- **Capacity:** 30,000mAh (10+ charges).\n\t- **Price:** \u20b98,500 approx.\n3. **Zendure SuperMini X5 (20,000mAh)**\n\t- **Output:** 65W, Power Delivery, PPS-compatible.\n\t- **Capacity:** 20,000mAh (6\u20138 charges).\n\t- **Price:** \u20b97,000 approx.\n4. **UGREEN 145W Power Bank (25,000mAh)**\n\t- **Output:** 145W max, excellent for One Plus fast charging.\n\t- **Capacity:** 25,000mAh (8\u201310 charges).\n\t- **Price:** \u20b910,000 approx.\n5. **Realme 10,000mAh 65W Power Bank**\n\t- **Output:** 65W (specifically SuperVOOC-compatible).\n\t- **Capacity:** 10,000mAh (3\u20134 charges, smaller form factor).\n\t- **Price:** \u20b93,500 approx.\n\nThese options balance **speed, capacity, and portability** while ensuring compatibility with One Plus\u2019 charging technology.",
