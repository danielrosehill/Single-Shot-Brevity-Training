  "prompt": "I own a One Plus Nord 3 5G.\n\nI need to pick up a power bank. This power bank would not be used for travel so forget airline limits.\n\nHere, instead, is the combination I'm looking for:\n\n- Charges the phone as quickly as possible. One Plus supports SuperVOOC so ... something that gets as close to the max this can deliver as possible (assuming the right cables, etc; whatever to ensure that the power bank itself is not a constraint)\n\n- As large a capacity as is credible. Disreputable manufacturers often make wild and barely feasible claims about the capacity of their power banks. I want to purchase something that achieves what it says. I want the largest power bank that I can purchase while staying within the portable power bank form factor (ie, something that can be slotted into a backpack). This does not need to be pocket sized. \n\nPlease provide these answers:\n\n1: Tech spec: what am I looking for? What parameters do I need?\n\n2: What's the max capacity, approximately, think is credible.\n\n3: Manufacturers and product names: give me 5 good options each with an RRP. Be specific (manufacturer, PN).",
