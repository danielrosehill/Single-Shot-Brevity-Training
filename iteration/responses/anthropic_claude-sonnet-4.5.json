  "prompt": "I own a One Plus Nord 3 5G.\n\nI need to pick up a power bank. This power bank would not be used for travel so forget airline limits.\n\nHere, instead, is the combination I'm looking for:\n\n- Charges the phone as quickly as possible. One Plus supports SuperVOOC so ... something that gets as close to the max this can deliver as possible (assuming the right cables, etc; whatever to ensure that the power bank itself is not a constraint)\n\n- As large a capacity as is credible. Disreputable manufacturers often make wild and barely feasible claims about the capacity of their power banks. I want to purchase something that achieves what it says. I want the largest power bank that I can purchase while staying within the portable power bank form factor (ie, something that can be slotted into a backpack). This does not need to be pocket sized. \n\nPlease provide these answers:\n\n1: Tech spec: what am I looking for? What parameters do I need?\n\n2: What's the max capacity, approximately, think is credible.\n\n3: Manufacturers and product names: give me 5 good options each with an RRP. Be specific (manufacturer, PN).",
  "response": "# Power Bank Recommendations for OnePlus Nord 3 5G\n\n## 1. Tech Specs You Need\n\n**Charging Speed:**\n- **SuperVOOC 80W** support (Nord 3 5G supports 80W charging)\n- Look for USB-C output with **PD (Power Delivery) 65W minimum** or proprietary VOOC/SuperVOOC protocol\n- Reality check: Most third-party power banks won't replicate full 80W SuperVOOC, but 65W PD will charge very fast\n\n**Capacity:**\n- **25,000-27,000 mAh** is the sweet spot for maximum credible capacity in portable form\n- This translates to approximately **90-100Wh** (airline limit is 100Wh, which helps verify legitimacy)\n- Anything claiming 50,000+ mAh at portable size is likely fake/exaggerated\n\n**Other specs to verify:**\n- Reputable battery cells (LG, Samsung, or explicitly stated quality cells)\n- Multiple certifications (UL, CE, FCC, RoHS)\n- Clear Wh rating printed on device\n\n## 2. Maximum Credible Capacity\n\n**27,000 mAh / ~100Wh** is the realistic maximum for:\n- Legitimate manufacturers\n- Truly portable form factor (roughly smartphone-sized, 500-600g weight)\n- Won't be pocket-sized but easily backpack-portable\n\n## 3. Five Specific Product Recommendations\n\n### 1. **Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)**\n- **Model:** A1289\n- **Capacity:** 24,000 mAh / 86.4Wh\n- **Output:** 140W USB-C PD (65W for your phone)\n- **RRP:** $149.99 / \u00a3149.99\n- **Notes:** Premium build, Anker reliability, will fast-charge Nord 3\n\n### 2. **UGREEN 25000mAh Power Bank 145W**\n- **Model:** PB205\n- **Capacity:** 25,000 mAh / 90Wh\n- **Output:** 145W total, USB-C up to 100W PD\n- **RRP:** $119.99 / \u00a3109.99\n- **Notes:** Excellent value, supports multiple fast-charge protocols\n\n### 3. **Baseus Blade 100W Power Bank**\n- **Model:** PPBL000201 (20,000 mAh) or PPBL000301 (25,000 mAh version if available in your region)\n- **Capacity:** 20,000 mAh / 74Wh\n- **Output:** 100W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $89.99 / \u00a379.99\n- **Notes:** Ultra-slim design, good build quality\n\n### 4. **RAVPower 26800mAh PD Power Bank**\n- **Model:** RP-PB058\n- **Capacity:** 26,800 mAh / 99.16Wh\n- **Output:** 60W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $99.99 / \u00a389.99\n- **Notes:** Maximum capacity just under 100Wh limit, proven reliability\n\n### 5. **Shargeek Storm 2 Slim**\n- **Model:** Storm 2 Slim\n- **Capacity:** 20,000 mAh / 74Wh (or Storm 2 at 25,600 mAh/100Wh)\n- **Output:** 100W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $119-169 depending on version\n- **Notes:** Transparent design, premium feel, great tech specs\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **Cable matters:** Use a quality USB-C to USB-C cable rated for 100W+ to avoid bottlenecking\n- **Native SuperVOOC:** Only official OnePlus power banks guarantee full 80W SuperVOOC, but they typically have smaller capacities (~10,000 mAh)\n- **Real-world performance:** A 65W PD power bank will charge your Nord 3 to 80% in roughly 30-35 minutes vs 25 minutes with native 80W\n\n**My top pick for your needs:** UGREEN PB205 or Anker 737 - both offer maximum credible capacity with fast charging from reputable manufacturers.",
