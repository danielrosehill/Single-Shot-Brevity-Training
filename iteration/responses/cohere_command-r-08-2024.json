  "prompt": "I own a One Plus Nord 3 5G.\n\nI need to pick up a power bank. This power bank would not be used for travel so forget airline limits.\n\nHere, instead, is the combination I'm looking for:\n\n- Charges the phone as quickly as possible. One Plus supports SuperVOOC so ... something that gets as close to the max this can deliver as possible (assuming the right cables, etc; whatever to ensure that the power bank itself is not a constraint)\n\n- As large a capacity as is credible. Disreputable manufacturers often make wild and barely feasible claims about the capacity of their power banks. I want to purchase something that achieves what it says. I want the largest power bank that I can purchase while staying within the portable power bank form factor (ie, something that can be slotted into a backpack). This does not need to be pocket sized. \n\nPlease provide these answers:\n\n1: Tech spec: what am I looking for? What parameters do I need?\n\n2: What's the max capacity, approximately, think is credible.\n\n3: Manufacturers and product names: give me 5 good options each with an RRP. Be specific (manufacturer, PN).",
  "response": "Certainly, let's ensure you get the right power bank for your needs! \n\n1. Tech Specs: \n\nTo achieve fast charging for your One Plus Nord 3 5G, you'll want to look for a power bank that supports the SuperVOOC (Super Voltage Optimized Charging) standard. SuperVOOC is a technology developed by OPPO (which is closely associated with OnePlus) to offer incredibly fast charging speeds. It delivers up to 65W of power, enabling rapid charging of compatible devices. \n\nTherefore, the key parameters to look out for are:\n- Power Output: Look for a power bank that can deliver a high power output of at least 65W. \n- Ports and Compatibility: Ensure the power bank has a compatible port (USB-C) that supports the SuperVOOC standard. Some power banks may be labeled as supporting 'OPPO Dart Charge' which is essentially the same as SuperVOOC. \n- Battery Capacity: As you want the largest capacity, opt for a power bank with a high mAh (milliamp-hour) rating. \n\n2. Max Capacity Credibility: \n\nReputable power banks with large capacities typically have a battery capacity of around 20,000 - 25,000 mAh. While there are power banks with even higher capacity ratings available, it's crucial to strike a balance between battery life and the overall weight and size of the power bank for portability. \n\n3. Manufacturer Recommendations with Products and RRPs (Recommended Retail Price): \n\nHere are five reliable manufacturers with recommended power bank products that should fit your criteria: \n\n1. Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000+: \n- Manufacturer: Anker \n- Product Name: PowerCore Fusion 5000+ Power Bank with Wireless Charger, 24W Power Delivery \n- RRP: $49.99 \n\n2.
