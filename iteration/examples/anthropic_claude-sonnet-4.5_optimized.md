# Optimized Brief Response - Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Prompt
I own a One Plus Nord 3 5G.

I need to pick up a power bank. This power bank would not be used for travel so forget airline limits.

Here, instead, is the combination I'm looking for:

- Charges the phone as quickly as possible. One Plus supports SuperVOOC so ... something that gets as close to the max this can deliver as possible (assuming the right cables, etc; whatever to ensure that the power bank itself is not a constraint)

- As large a capacity as is credible. Disreputable manufacturers often make wild and barely feasible claims about the capacity of their power banks. I want to purchase something that achieves what it says. I want the largest power bank that I can purchase while staying within the portable power bank form factor (ie, something that can be slotted into a backpack). This does not need to be pocket sized.

Please provide these answers:

1: Tech spec: what am I looking for? What parameters do I need?

2: What's the max capacity, approximately, think is credible.

3: Manufacturers and product names: give me 5 good options each with an RRP. Be specific (manufacturer, PN).

## Optimized Response

**1. Tech Specs:**
- 65W+ USB-C PD output (Nord 3 supports 80W SuperVOOC; 65W PD will charge very fast)
- 25,000-27,000 mAh capacity
- ~90-100Wh (verification: legitimate brands stay under 100Wh airline limit)
- Quality battery cells (Samsung/LG), multiple certifications (UL, CE, FCC)

**2. Max Credible Capacity:**
27,000 mAh / ~100Wh (anything claiming 50,000+ mAh at portable size is exaggerated)

**3. Five Options:**

1. **Anker 737 (A1289)** - 24,000 mAh, 140W PD, $149.99
2. **UGREEN PB205** - 25,000 mAh, 145W total, 100W PD, $119.99
3. **Baseus Blade PPBL000201** - 20,000 mAh, 100W PD, $89.99
4. **RAVPower RP-PB058** - 26,800 mAh, 60W PD, $99.99
5. **Shargeek Storm 2 Slim** - 20,000 mAh, 100W PD, $119-169

**Top pick:** UGREEN PB205 or Anker 737 for max capacity + fast charging from reputable brands.

**Note:** Use quality 100W+ USB-C cable. 65W PD charges to 80% in ~30-35 min vs native 80W at 25 min.
