Daniel — good call on going for a robust, high-capacity, high-speed power bank for your OnePlus Nord 3 5G. I’ve pulled together a full breakdown: what specs you should focus on, what “big but credible” capacity really means, and five specific models that are excellent candidates (with caveats) in the form-factor you want (back-packable, not airline-travel-limited). Let’s dive in.

---

## 1. What tech specs to look for

Since you want **maximum charging speed** (to match the Nord 3’s 80 W SUPERVOOC capability) *and* the largest credible capacity while keeping the unit portable, here are the key parameters you must check:

**a. Charging / Output capability for your phone**

* Your Nord 3 supports 80 W SUPERVOOC. ([OnePlus][1])
* Therefore the power bank should support a matching or very high output (ideally 80 W or more) in a protocol that your phone supports.
* So check: USB-C output (and if relevant USB-A), voltage and current (for example 5 V, 9 V, 12 V, 20 V) and whether it supports OnePlus’s proprietary SUPERVOOC (or at least a high-wattage PD/PPS scheme that the phone will accept).
* Also check the cable: a high‐current, low‐loss cable is required to actually deliver that wattage. The bank’s output spec must not be the bottleneck.

**b. Input / Recharging speed of power bank**

* The larger the bank, the more time it takes to recharge. If you go very large, you don’t want a bank that takes 10+ hours to refill. So check input wattage (USB-C in) and look for fast-recharge capability.
* Heat management and build quality matter: high power = more heat.

**c. Capacity rating and “real” usable capacity**

* The marketed capacity (in mAh) is often at nominal cell voltage (~3.7 V) but devices charge at higher output voltages and conversion losses occur. So the bank might deliver significantly less usable capacity. ([XYZtech][2])
* The Watt-Hour (Wh) rating is more meaningful: Wh = (mAh × Voltage) / 1000. ([UGREEN US][3])
* So when comparing “big capacity” banks, use Wh or realistic delivered output rather than just the headline mAh.

**d. Physical size, weight, form-factor**

* Since you’ll carry it in a backpack (not pocket sized), you can accept more size/weight — but there is a practical limit. Very large banks get heavy and cumbersome.
* Also check the port count (how many devices you might charge simultaneously), the build quality (brand reputation, cell quality, safety/certifications), and quality of the cables/ports.

**e. Safety / certification / cell quality**

* High current + large capacity = more risk if cheap components. Prefer established brands, good cell chemistry, proper protections (over-current, over-temperature, short circuit).
* Because you’re using it regularly (not just travel), longevity matters.

## 2. What’s the max capacity (credible) you should aim for

Given your form-factor (backpackable, everyday use), here are guidelines and what I’d suggest:

* A good quality power bank of **20,000 mAh** (≈ 74 Wh if at 3.7V) is solid. ([UGREEN US][3])
* Some banks go to 30,000 mAh or more, but for everyday carry the weight/size trade-off becomes significant, and also diminishing returns due to losses.
* Because of conversion losses (20-30%), a 20,000 mAh bank might realistically deliver equivalent of ~14,000 mAh at 5 V. ([XYZtech][2])
* For your phone (5,000 mAh battery), a 20,000 mAh bank could give you ~2-3 full charges in real world, maybe more.
* If you push beyond, say **30,000 mAh**, you’re getting into very large/heavy territory, and while possible, you start hitting issues like heat, recharge time, size, and diminishing returns unless you also charge tablets/laptops.

**My verdict:** For your use case (fast charging a phone, daily/commute/backpack), a credible **capacity of around 20,000 mAh** (or slightly more) is the sweet spot. If you find a very good one around 25-30k that keeps size/weight acceptable and supports high wattage output, that’s fine — but be cautious of mega numbers from unknown brands.

## 3. Five good manufacturer + product options (with RRP)

Here are five well-specified options that meet or approach your requirements. I have not verified in every case they reach the full 80 W for your phone’s exact protocol, so you’ll want to double-check compatibility (especially the SUPERVOOC part). But they are among the best bets.

| # | Manufacturer/Product                                                                                            | Key specs & notes                                                                                                                 | Approx RRP*                              |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 | OnePlus SUPERVOOC 150W Power Bank (20,000 mAh)                                                                  | 20,000 mAh typical, up to 100 W single-port (150 W shared) output, built-in cable. Supports SUPERVOOC + PD/PPS. ([Gizmochina][4]) | ~€87.90 (as listed) ([MyTrendyPhone][5]) |
| 2 | (Variant) OnePlus SUPERVOOC 100W Power Bank (12,000 mAh)                                                        | Smaller capacity but high output (100W) mentioned. ([Notebookcheck][6])                                                           | Price varies (China launch ~$48)         |
| 3 | (General high-capacity fast bank) — find a 20,000 mAh / 100 W bank from reliable brand (e.g., Baseus Blade Pro) | For example the Baseus Blade Pro 20K/100W is referenced in “best power banks 2025” lists. ([TechRadar][7])                        | Varies — likely ~$80-120 USD             |
| 4 | Another top brand (Anker, INIU, etc) — e.g., Anker PowerCore 20,000 mAh high-wattage bank                       | In the reviews they mention 20,000 mAh with ~65W output for phones/laptops. ([TechRadar][7])                                      | ~$70-100 USD                             |
| 5 | A premium spec bank aimed at multi-device / high-wattage (Laptop+ phone) — e.g., 24,000 mAh / 140W bank         | From review “Anker 737 PowerCore 24K” (24,000mAh, 140W) ([TechRadar][7])                                                          | Might be ~$120-150 USD                   |

*RRP approximate at time of search; local Israeli pricing & import duties may vary.

#### My recommended top pick for you:

Given your Nord 3 supports 80 W and your backpack usage, I believe the OnePlus SUPERVOOC 150W Power Bank (20,000 mAh) is the best single match: high capacity, ultra-fast output, likely the best compatibility with your phone’s charging protocol.

If you want “even more capacity”, you could go the 24k/140W route, but ensure size/weight still comfortable in your backpack (you’ll carry it regularly, so you don’t want something unwieldy).

## Additional notes & tips

* Use a high-quality USB-C to USB-C cable rated for the required wattage (e.g., 100W+) to avoid bottlenecks.
* Even if the bank supports 100W+ the phone may only take 80W — fine, the extra headroom is good.
* Recharge the bank overnight or when convenient — with large capacity it will still take time to refill.
* If you carry for multiple devices (tablet, other phones) check port count.
* Check the brand’s reliability in terms of cell quality and real world efficiency (avoid “cheap unknown brands” with inflated mAh claims).
* Although you said travel/airline limits are not relevant, still check for build quality and thermal management (for everyday use).
* In Israel, consider local availability/import cost and the cable/power supply you’ll use to charge the bank itself.

If you like, I can **scan the Israeli market** (ship‐to‐Israel or Israeli stock) for *currently available* power banks that meet **≥ 20,000 mAh and ≥ 80 W output** and list *real pricing in Israel / Europe*. Would you like that?
