 ## 1. What tech specs to look for
 
* Your Nord 3 supports 80 W SUPERVOOC.  
* Therefore the power bank should support a matching or very high output (ideally 80 W or more) in a protocol that your phone supports.
* So check: USB-C output (and if relevant USB-A), voltage and current (for example 5 V, 9 V, 12 V, 20 V) and whether it supports OnePlus’s proprietary SUPERVOOC (or at least a high-wattage PD/PPS scheme that the phone will accept).
* Also check the cable: a high‐current, low‐loss cable is required to actually deliver that wattage. The bank’s output spec must not be the bottleneck.


## 2. What’s the max capacity (credible) you should aim for

Given your form-factor (backpackable, everyday use), here are guidelines and what I’d suggest:

* A good quality power bank of **20,000 mAh** (≈ 74 Wh if at 3.7V) is solid.
* Some banks go to 30,000 mAh or more, but for everyday carry the weight/size trade-off becomes significant, and also diminishing returns due to losses.
 * If you push beyond, say **30,000 mAh**, you’re getting into very large/heavy territory, and while possible, you start hitting issues like heat, recharge time, size, and diminishing returns unless you also charge tablets/laptops.

## 3. Five good manufacturer + product options (with RRP)

| 2 | (Variant) OnePlus SUPERVOOC 100W Power Bank (12,000 mAh)                                                        | Smaller capacity but high output (100W) mentioned.                                                           | Price varies (China launch ~$48)         |
| 3 | (General high-capacity fast bank) — find a 20,000 mAh / 100 W bank from reliable brand (e.g., Baseus Blade Pro) | For example the Baseus Blade Pro 20K/100W is referenced in "best power banks 2025" lists.                        | Varies — likely ~$80-120 USD             |
| 4 | Another top brand (Anker, INIU, etc) — e.g., Anker PowerCore 20,000 mAh high-wattage bank                       | In the reviews they mention 20,000 mAh with ~65W output for phones/laptops.                                      | ~$70-100 USD                             |
| 5 | A premium spec bank aimed at multi-device / high-wattage (Laptop+ phone) — e.g., 24,000 mAh / 140W bank         | From review "Anker 737 PowerCore 24K" (24,000mAh, 140W)                                                          | Might be ~$120-150 USD                   |

*RRP approximate at time of search; local Israeli pricing & import duties may vary.

#### My recommended top pick for you:

Given your Nord 3 supports 80 W and your backpack usage, I believe the OnePlus SUPERVOOC 150W Power Bank (20,000 mAh) is the best single match: high capacity, ultra-fast output, likely the best compatibility with your phone’s charging protocol.

If you want "even more capacity", you could go the 24k/140W route, but ensure size/weight still comfortable in your backpack (you'll carry it regularly, so you don't want something unwieldy).
