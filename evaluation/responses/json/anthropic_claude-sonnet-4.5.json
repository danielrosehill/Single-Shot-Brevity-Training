Tech Specs You Need\n\n**Charging Speed:**\n- **SuperVOOC 80W** support (Nord 3 5G supports 80W charging)\n- Look for USB-C output with **PD (Power Delivery) 65W minimum** or proprietary VOOC/SuperVOOC protocol\n- Reality check: Most third-party power banks won't replicate full 80W SuperVOOC, but 65W PD will charge very fast\n\n**Capacity:**\n- **25,000-27,000 mAh** is the sweet spot for maximum credible capacity in portable form\n- This translates to approximately **90-100Wh** (airline limit is 100Wh, which helps verify legitimacy)\n- Anything claiming 50,000+ mAh at portable size is likely fake/exaggerated\n\n**Other specs to verify:**\n- Reputable battery cells (LG, Samsung, or explicitly stated quality cells)\n- Multiple certifications (UL, CE, FCC, RoHS)\n- Clear Wh rating printed on device\n\n## 2. Maximum Credible Capacity\n\n**27,000 mAh / ~100Wh** is the realistic maximum for:\n- Legitimate manufacturers\n- Truly portable form factor (roughly smartphone-sized, 500-600g weight)\n- Won't be pocket-sized but easily backpack-portable\n\n## 3. Five Specific Product Recommendations\n\n### 1. **Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)**\n- **Model:** A1289\n- **Capacity:** 24,000 mAh / 86.4Wh\n- **Output:** 140W USB-C PD (65W for your phone)\n- **RRP:** $149.99 / \u00a3149.99\n- **Notes:** Premium build, Anker reliability, will fast-charge Nord 3\n\n### 2. **UGREEN 25000mAh Power Bank 145W**\n- **Model:** PB205\n- **Capacity:** 25,000 mAh / 90Wh\n- **Output:** 145W total, USB-C up to 100W PD\n- **RRP:** $119.99 / \u00a3109.99\n- **Notes:** Excellent value, supports multiple fast-charge protocols\n\n### 3. **Baseus Blade 100W Power Bank**\n- **Model:** PPBL000201 (20,000 mAh) or PPBL000301 (25,000 mAh version if available in your region)\n- **Capacity:** 20,000 mAh / 74Wh\n- **Output:** 100W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $89.99 / \u00a379.99\n- **Notes:** Ultra-slim design, good build quality\n\n### 4. **RAVPower 26800mAh PD Power Bank**\n- **Model:** RP-PB058\n- **Capacity:** 26,800 mAh / 99.16Wh\n- **Output:** 60W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $99.99 / \u00a389.99\n- **Notes:** Maximum capacity just under 100Wh limit, proven reliability\n\n### 5. **Shargeek Storm 2 Slim**\n- **Model:** Storm 2 Slim\n- **Capacity:** 20,000 mAh / 74Wh (or Storm 2 at 25,600 mAh/100Wh)\n- **Output:** 100W USB-C PD\n- **RRP:** $119-169 depending on version\n- **Notes:** Transparent design, premium feel, great tech specs\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **Cable matters:** Use a quality USB-C to USB-C cable rated for 100W+ to avoid bottlenecking\n- **Native SuperVOOC:** Only official OnePlus power banks guarantee full 80W SuperVOOC, but they typically have smaller capacities (~10,000 mAh)\n- **Real-world performance:** A 65W PD power bank will charge your Nord 3 to 80% in roughly 30-35 minutes vs 25 minutes with native 80W\n\n**My top pick for your needs:** UGREEN PB205 or Anker 737 - both offer maximum credible capacity with fast charging from reputable manufacturers.",
