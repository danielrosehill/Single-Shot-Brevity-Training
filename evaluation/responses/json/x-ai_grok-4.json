A quick note on compatibility: The Nord 3 supports up to 80W SuperVOOC (a proprietary fast-charging protocol from OnePlus/OPPO). However, most third-party power banks don't natively support SuperVOOC, as it's not a widely licensed standard. Instead, they rely on USB Power Delivery (PD) or other protocols, which the Nord 3 can use but typically at reduced speeds (e.g., up to ~30-45W via PD, depending on the setup). To get as close as possible to 80W, you'll need a power bank with high-wattage output (ideally 65W+ per port), a compatible USB-C cable (e.g., one rated for 100W+ with e-marker chip), and potentially a power bank that supports VOOC-like protocols if available. Official OnePlus/OPPO power banks can hit full SuperVOOC speeds but are limited in capacity. For larger capacities, we're trading some speed for size\u2014high-PD output will still charge much faster than standard 18W.\n\nI'll focus on reputable manufacturers (e.g., Anker, Baseus, Ugreen) with credible specs\u2014no sketchy AliExpress brands with exaggerated claims. Capacities are based on rated mAh at 3.7V (standard for lithium-ion), but actual usable energy is lower due to conversion losses (e.g., a 20,000mAh bank might deliver ~13,000-15,000mAh at 5V output).\n\n### 1: Tech Spec: What Am I Looking For? What Parameters Do I Need?\nTo maximize charging speed for your Nord 3 while ensuring a large, credible capacity in a portable (backpack-friendly) form factor, prioritize these specs:\n- **Output Power/Protocols**: At least 65W per port (ideally 100W+ total/shared) via USB-C with USB PD 3.0 (or higher) support. This gets you close to SuperVOOC speeds (e.g., 30-45W on the Nord 3). Look for PPS (Programmable Power Supply) support for better voltage negotiation. If possible, seek VOOC/SuperVOOC compatibility (rare in large banks, but some Baseus models claim partial support). Avoid banks limited to 18W-20W output.\n- **Capacity**: Rated in mAh (e.g., 20,000-50,000mAh) at nominal voltage (usually 3.7V). Check Wh (watt-hours) for real energy (e.g., 74Wh for ~20,000mAh). Aim for lithium-polymer cells from reputable sources to avoid inflated claims.\n- **Ports**: At least one USB-C PD output (for your phone) and preferably multiple ports (e.g., USB-A for extras). Input should support fast recharging (e.g., 45W+ PD input).\n- **Form Factor/Weight**: Backpack-portable means under ~1-2 lbs (450-900g) and dimensions like 6-8 inches long (not ultra-compact pocket size, but not a brick). Avoid anything over 10 inches or 2 lbs, as it loses portability.\n- **Other Essentials**: Built-in cables optional but handy; LCD display for battery level; safety certifications (e.g., UL, FCC, overcharge protection); and a warranty (1-2 years). Use a high-quality USB-C to USB-C cable rated for 100W (e.g., Anker PowerLine III) to minimize bottlenecks\u2014SuperVOOC requires specific voltage/current (e.g., 10V/6.5A), so PD approximations won't hit 80W but can get close.\n- **Credibility Check**: Stick to brands with verifiable reviews on Amazon/Best Buy. Ignore no-name brands claiming 100,000mAh in tiny packages\u2014that's physically impossible without fake cells.\n\nWith the right setup, you could achieve ~45-65W charging speeds, which is close to the Nord 3's max without an official SuperVOOC bank.\n\n### 2: What's the Max Capacity, Approximately, That Is Credible?\nFor a credible, portable power bank from reputable manufacturers, the maximum realistic capacity is around 30,000-50,000mAh (roughly 111-185Wh). This is achievable in a backpack-friendly form factor (e.g., 6-7 inches long, 1-1.5 lbs) without resorting to disreputable brands that fake specs. Beyond 50,000mAh, options exist (e.g., some ROMOSS or Krisdonia models claim 60,000mAh+), but they often sacrifice output power (dropping to 20-30W), use lower-quality cells, or have dubious capacity claims (independent tests show 20-30% less than advertised). High-power banks (65W+) tend to top out at 25,000-30,000mAh to keep size/weight down and heat manageable. If you push to 50,000mAh, expect slightly slower charging due to thermal limits, but it's still credible from brands like Baseus or INIU.\n\n### 3: Manufacturers and Product Names: 5 Good Options Each with an RRP\nHere are 5 solid recommendations, prioritized for high output (to approach SuperVOOC speeds), credible large capacities, and portability. I selected from reputable brands with strong user reviews and lab-tested specs (e.g., via sites like RTINGS or Amazon aggregates). Prices are approximate US RRPs (as of my last knowledge in 2023; check current listings for deals). All are backpack-portable and can charge your Nord 3 at 30-65W+ with a good cable. I've noted if they have any VOOC affinity.\n\n1. **Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)** - 24,000mAh (86.4Wh), 140W max output (PD 3.1 with PPS). Great for fast charging (up to 140W shared). Weight: 1.3 lbs. RRP: $149.99.\n   \n2. **Ugreen 145W Power Bank (Model: PB205)** - 25,000mAh (92.5Wh), 145W max output (PD 3.0 with PPS; single port up to 100W). Excellent build quality and fast recharge. Weight: 1.1 lbs. RRP: $99.99.\n\n3. **Baseus 65W Power Bank (Model: BS-67W30K)** - 30,000mAh (111Wh), 65W max output (PD 3.0 with some VOOC protocol support reported in reviews). One of the larger credible options with decent speed. Weight: 1.4 lbs. RRP: $59.99.\n\n4. **INIU 100W Power Bank (Model: BI-B62)** - 25,000mAh (92.5Wh), 100W max output (PD 3.0 with PPS). Compact for its power, with good heat management. Weight: 1.0 lb. RRP: $79.99.\n\n5. **Shargeek Storm 2 Power Bank (Model: STORM2)** - 25,600mAh (93.5Wh), 100W max output (PD 3.0). Unique transparent design, high build quality, and fast multi-device charging. Weight: 1.3 lbs. RRP: $229.00 (premium pricing, but highly rated for reliability).\n\nIf you want even closer to full SuperVOOC, consider the official OnePlus SUPERVOOC 80W Power Bank (10,000mAh, ~$50), but it sacrifices capacity. For purchases, check Amazon, Best Buy, or the manufacturers' sites\u2014read recent reviews to confirm real-world capacity (e.g., via discharge tests). If none of these fit, let me know more details!",
