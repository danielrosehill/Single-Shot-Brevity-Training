  "response": "Short answer first:\n- You\u2019ll only get near-OnePlus \u201cfast\u201d speeds from a power bank that supports OPPO/OnePlus VOOC/SUPERVOOC (or realme Dart/SuperDart). Most mainstream PD banks will charge your Nord 3 much slower.\n- The Nord 3\u2019s in-box wired spec is 80W SUPERVOOC. The best widely available VOOC-compatible power banks top out around 50\u201365W, so you\u2019ll get \u201cfast\u201d but not full 80W from a bank.\n- If you want very large capacity, you\u2019ll likely be using a high-quality USB PD power bank (not VOOC), which will charge your Nord 3 at a reduced rate (typically 18\u201327W, sometimes ~45W if the handset\u2019s PD support allows).\n\n1) What tech spec to look for\n- Fast-charge protocol:\n  - Ideal: Explicit VOOC/SUPERVOOC/Dart/SuperDart support, with outputs like 10V/6.5A or 11V/6\u20137A. That\u2019s what unlocks \u201cOnePlus-fast\u201d speeds from a bank.\n  - Otherwise: USB Power Delivery (PD 3.0/3.1) with PPS. Your Nord 3 will then charge at a reduced PD rate (expect 18\u201327W; some OnePlus models do up to ~45W PD, but not the full 80W).\n- Cable: Use an original/genuine OPPO/OnePlus/realme VOOC/SUPERVOOC cable (rated 6.5A). Without the right cable, VOOC banks will fall back to slower modes.\n- Capacity/energy:\n  - Prioritize Watt-hours (Wh), not just mAh. Credible banks disclose Wh (mAh ratings are at 3.6\u20133.7V cell voltage, not at 5V output).\n  - For reference: 10,000mAh \u2248 37Wh; 20,000mAh \u2248 74Wh; 30,000mAh \u2248 111Wh; 50,000mAh \u2248 185Wh.\n- Output power:\n  - Per-port and total output in watts.\n  - For VOOC, look for at least 50W VOOC/Dart. For PD-only banks, 45\u2013140W PD is fine for future devices and fast self\u2011recharge.\n- Input (self-charging) speed: Prefer 45\u2013100W PD input so the bank refills quickly.\n- Cells and safety: High-quality cells (often 21700), rated cycle life \u2265500, with proper protections (OTP, OVP, SCP). Reputable brands publish certification (CE/FCC/UKCA/PSE).\n\n2) Max credible capacity (backpackable)\n- Realistic, reputable \u201cpower bank\u201d ceiling: about 30,000\u201350,000mAh (\u2248111\u2013185Wh). Above this you\u2019re into heavy bricks or \u201cpower station\u201d territory.\n- Weight check: ~30,000mAh is ~600\u2013800g; ~50,000mAh is ~1.0\u20131.3kg. Anything claiming 60,000\u2013100,000mAh in a small case is usually overstated or measures at 3.7V but implies 5V.\n- Practical estimate for your Nord 3 (\u22485000mAh battery):\n  - 20,000mAh bank: ~2.5\u20133 full charges (after conversion losses).\n  - 30,000mAh bank: ~4\u20135 charges.\n  - 50,000mAh bank: ~7\u20138+ charges.\n\n3) Specific product options (fastest with VOOC vs biggest capacity with PD)\nNote: Availability and model codes can vary by region; RRPs/MSRPs shown are typical at launch.\n\nA) VOOC/SUPERVOOC-compatible (for the fastest possible charging on OnePlus)\n1) realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart Power Bank\n- Manufacturer: realme\n- Model name: realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart Power Bank (regional SKUs vary)\n- Output: Up to 50W SuperDart/VOOC on USB-A; USB-C PD up to 45\u201350W (2\u2011way fast charge)\n- RRP (India at launch): ~INR 3,499\n- Why: One of the rare banks that actually speaks VOOC-family fast charge, typically delivering 50W-class charging to OnePlus/OPPO/realme phones.\n\n2) OnePlus 10000mAh 33W Power Bank\n- Manufacturer: OnePlus\n- Model name: OnePlus 10,000mAh 33W Power Bank (regional SKU varies)\n- Output: Up to 33W Warp/SUPERVOOC on USB-A; PD on USB-C\n- RRP (India at launch): ~INR 2,299\n- Why: Genuine OnePlus accessory; while it won\u2019t hit 80W, it provides proprietary fast charging above standard PD levels.\n\n3) OPPO 10000mAh 33W VOOC Flash Charge Power Bank (Power Bank 2)\n- Manufacturer: OPPO\n- Model name: OPPO 10,000mAh VOOC Power Bank (33W version; regional SKU varies)\n- Output: VOOC up to 33W; PD on USB-C\n- RRP (China at launch): ~CNY 199\u2013249\n- Why: VOOC-backed bank from OPPO; compatible with OnePlus fast-charge family, faster than PD on OnePlus.\n\nNotes on VOOC banks:\n- They\u2019re typically limited to 10,000mAh. If you need both VOOC speed and big capacity, you may need to carry two, or accept PD speed for a big single bank.\n\nB) High-capacity, reputable PD/PPS banks (maximum credible capacity; will charge your Nord 3 at its PD rate, not SUPERVOOC)\n4) Anker 347 Power Bank (PowerCore 40K)\n- Manufacturer: Anker\n- Part number: A1379 (PowerCore 40K)\n- Capacity: 40,000mAh (\u2248148Wh)\n- Output: Up to 30W USB\u2011C PD (multiple ports)\n- MSRP (US): ~$99.99\n- Why: Very large, credible capacity from a top-tier brand; rock-solid cell quality and protections. Expect your Nord 3 to charge at its PD rate (not VOOC).\n\n5) Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)\n- Manufacturer: Anker\n- Part number: A1289\n- Capacity: 24,000mAh (\u224886.4Wh)\n- Output: Up to 140W USB\u2011C PD 3.1 (great for laptops), fast 100W PD input to refill the bank\n- MSRP (US): ~$159.99\n- Why: Extremely fast PD for broader use and very fast self\u2011recharge; while your Nord 3 will charge at its PD ceiling only, this is a versatile, premium pick.\n\nIf you want one \u201cbig but still premium\u201d PD bank with higher output than the 40K Anker, consider:\n- UGREEN 145W 25,000mAh Power Bank (model varies by region, often listed as 145W/25,000mAh). MSRP ~US$149.99. Excellent PD/PPS support and quick self\u2011recharge. Again, your Nord 3 will charge at PD rate.\n\nBuying/verification tips\n- Check the energy rating (Wh) on the spec label or datasheet; compare weight to sanity\u2011check capacity.\n- For OnePlus\u2011fast charging: confirm the product explicitly lists VOOC/Dart/SUPERVOOC, not just \u201c33W/45W\u201d without protocol detail.\n- Use an original OPPO/OnePlus/realme 6.5A cable for VOOC/SUPERVOOC results.\n- For large PD banks, prefer brands that publish PD/PPS profiles (e.g., 5\u201311V PPS ranges) and input wattage so you can refill quickly with a capable wall charger.\n\nQuick recommendations by priority\n- Fastest possible on your Nord 3: realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart PB (carry two if you want more total energy).\n- Biggest credible single bank: Anker 347 PowerCore 40K (huge capacity; charges Nord 3 at PD speed).\n- Best all\u2011round premium PD: Anker 737 PowerCore 24K (top PD performance; great if you also charge laptops).\n\nIf you tell me your country/region and budget, I can pin exact model codes/availability and current pricing in your market, and confirm the fastest VOOC-capable option you can actually buy locally.",
