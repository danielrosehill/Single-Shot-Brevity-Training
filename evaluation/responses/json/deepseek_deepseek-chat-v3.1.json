The OnePlus Nord 3 5G is a great candidate for this, as it supports OnePlus's proprietary SuperVOOC fast charging.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n### 1. Tech Spec: What You Are Looking For\n\nTo charge your OnePlus Nord 3 5G at its maximum possible speed from a power bank, you need to match its charging protocol. The phone comes with an 80W SuperVOOC charger.\n\nHere are the critical parameters to look for:\n\n*   **Output Protocol:** This is the most important spec. You must look for a power bank that explicitly lists **SuperVOOC** or **VOOC** support. While it may support PD (Power Delivery) and QC (Quick Charge), these will not charge your OnePlus phone at its maximum speed. The power bank's specifications should state a output rating like \"5V/6A\" or \"10V/6.5A\", which are the hallmarks of the VOOC/SuperVOOC protocol.\n*   **Output Power:** Aim for a power bank rated for **80W output or higher** on its SuperVOOC/VOOC port. While your phone may not draw a full 80W for the entire cycle, this ensures the power bank can deliver the peak power the phone requests. A 50W or 65W SuperVOOC power bank would still be excellent and very fast.\n*   **Input Power:** For a large capacity power bank, high **input charging speed (e.g., 65W, 90W)** is crucial. You don't want to spend 10 hours recharging your 30,000mAh power bank. A high input spec means you can refill the power bank itself very quickly.\n*   **Capacity (mAh/Wh):** This is the fuel tank size. Look for the **Energy rating in Watt-hours (Wh)**. This is a more accurate measure than milliamp-hours (mAh) because it accounts for voltage. For large power banks, this is the standard unit.\n*   **Cable:** **You must use a compatible SuperVOOC cable.** The original cable that came with your phone is ideal. These cables have special pins to handle the high current of the VOOC protocol. A standard USB-C cable will not work for max speed.\n\n### 2. Maximum Credible Capacity\n\nFor a portable power bank that can still reasonably fit in a backpack (not a massive \"camping\" power station), the current practical maximum is **around 27,000mAh to 30,000mAh** (**~100Wh**).\n\nThis is specifically due to a *de facto* limit: the **99.96 Wh** limit for air travel. While you stated airline limits are not a concern, this threshold has become an industry standard for what is considered a \"portable\" power bank. Virtually all major manufacturers cap their mainstream large-capacity models at just under 100Wh for global compatibility. Going significantly beyond this (e.g., 150Wh, 200Wh) moves you into a much larger, heavier, and less common product category.\n\nTherefore, a **credible maximum capacity is 27,000mAh (typically at 3.7V) or 100Wh.**\n\n### 3. Manufacturer & Product Recommendations\n\nHere are 5 excellent options, focusing on brands known for quality cells and accurate ratings. Prices are approximate MSRP and can vary with sales.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. OnePlus 50W Power Bank (30,000mAh)\n*   **Manufacturer & Model:** OnePlus (Official). Model is simply \"50W Power Bank\".\n*   **Why it's a good option:** This is the **guaranteed perfect match** for your phone. It is designed specifically for OnePlus devices and will deliver the full 50W SuperVOOC charging it's rated for. It's from the same manufacturer, so compatibility is absolute.\n*   **Key Specs:** 30,000mAh (111.9Wh* - note this is over the airline limit), 50W SuperVOOC Output, 45W Input.\n*   **RRP:** Approximately $90 - $110 USD.\n*   *Note: While over 100Wh, its form factor is still very portable for a backpack.*\n\n#### 2. Anker 737 PowerCore 24K (PowerCore 24K / 140W)\n*   **Manufacturer & Model:** Anker (Prime series). Model: Anker 737 PowerCore 24K (A1289).\n*   **Why it's a good option:** Anker is arguably the top brand in the industry for reliability and quality. This is their flagship power bank. While it doesn't have a dedicated SuperVOOC port, its **140W USB-C port is PPS (Programmable Power Supply) enabled**. With the correct cable, it can negotiate high-current, low-voltage charging that is often compatible with VOOC protocols at very high speeds (likely near its max, though perhaps not the full 80W). It also recharges itself in under an hour.\n*   **Key Specs:** 24,000mAh (86.4Wh), 140W max output (PPS), 140W max input.\n*   **RRP:** Approximately $150 - $180 USD.\n\n#### 3. UGREEN 145W Power Bank 25,000mAh\n*   **Manufacturer & Model:** UGREEN (Nexode series). Model: UGREEN Nexode 145W (CM319).\n*   **Why it's a good option:** UGREEN makes excellent charging gear. This model is a direct competitor to the Anker 737. Like the Anker, it uses PPS on its USB-C ports to achieve wide compatibility with fast charging protocols, including high-speed charging for OnePlus phones. It has a massive total output for charging multiple devices.\n*   **Key Specs:** 25,000mAh (90Wh), 145W max output (PPS), 100W max input.\n*   **RRP:** Approximately $140 - $160 USD.\n\n#### 4. Realme 33W Power Bank (30,000mAh)\n*   **Manufacturer & Model:** realme (Official). Often listed as \"realme 30W Dart Charge Power Bank\" or similar.\n*   **Why it's a good option:** realme's Dart Charge is a rebrand of OPPO's VOOC technology. It is fundamentally the same protocol as SuperVOOC and is **fully compatible with OnePlus phones**. This will provide a true, native VOOC fast charging experience, just at a slightly lower wattage (still very fast). It's often more affordable than the official OnePlus option.\n*   **Key Specs:** 30,000mAh (111Wh), 33W Dart Charge (VOOC) Output.\n*   **RRP:** Approximately $70 - $85 USD. (Excellent value for the capacity and guaranteed compatibility).\n\n#### 5. SHARGE 100W SuperVOOC Power Bank (20,000mAh)\n*   **Manufacturer & Model:** SHARGE (Shargeek). Model: Sharge 100 (Storm 2).\n*   **Why it's a good option:** SHARGE is a brand beloved by tech enthusiasts for its unique transparent design, high performance, and **explicit support for SuperVOOC**. This is one of the few non-OEM power banks that proudly advertises direct SuperVOOC support. It's built with high-quality components and features a informative display showing power levels and rates.\n*   **Key Specs:** 20,000mAh (74Wh), 100W max Output (with SuperVOOC support), 100W Input.\n*   **RRP:** Approximately $130 - $150 USD.\n\n### Summary and Final Recommendation\n\n*   **For Guaranteed Max Speed & High Capacity:** The **OnePlus 50W Power Bank (30,000mAh)** is your safest, no-compromise bet.\n*   **For Best Overall Brand & Tech (with likely high compatibility):** The **Anker 737 PowerCore 24K** is a superb product from the most trusted brand.\n*   **For Best Value with Guaranteed Compatibility:** The **realme 33W Power Bank (30,000mAh)** offers massive capacity and true VOOC charging for a significantly lower price.\n\n**Crucial Final Tip:** Whichever power bank you choose, **always use your original OnePlus SuperVOOC cable** to ensure you achieve the fastest possible charging speeds.",
