This is an excellent question because it highlights a common challenge in the tech world: the conflict between proprietary fast-charging standards and the high-capacity power bank market, which largely leans on the universal Power Delivery (PD) standard.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n### 1: Tech Spec: What am I looking for?\n\nTo get the absolute fastest charging for your OnePlus Nord 3 5G, you need to match its proprietary technology. Here are the key parameters, in order of importance:\n\n**1. Charging Protocol: SuperVOOC**\nThis is the most critical spec. Your phone supports **80W SuperVOOC**. This is a proprietary protocol developed by OnePlus/Oppo. A standard power bank, even one with 100W or more of Power Delivery (PD), **will not charge your phone at 80W**. It will default to a slower, universal charging speed (typically 18W).\n*   **What to look for:** The text **\"80W SuperVOOC\"** or **\"OPPO SuperVOOC\"** must be explicitly mentioned in the power bank's specifications. Don't assume a high-wattage USB-C port will be enough.\n\n**2. Power Output (Watts):**\n*   **What to look for:** A USB-C port that can deliver **at least 80W** via the SuperVOOC protocol. The product description should say something like \"USB-C Output: 80W SuperVOOC\".\n\n**3. Capacity (mAh and Wh):**\nThis is where you need to be savvy. Manufacturers advertise capacity in milliamp-hours (mAh), but the real measure of energy is watt-hours (Wh). Due to energy loss from heat and voltage conversion (from the internal 3.7V to the external 5V/9V/12V), you never get the full advertised mAh.\n*   **What to look for:**\n    *   **Advertised Capacity:** 10,000mAh, 20,000mAh, 30,000mAh, etc.\n    *   **Rated Capacity:** Reputable brands often list a \"Rated Capacity\" at a specific voltage (e.g., 5V). This is a much more honest figure of what you can actually expect. For a 30,000mAh power bank, a rated capacity of around 18,000mAh is realistic.\n    *   **Watt-hours (Wh):** This is the key for understanding true energy and safety. It's calculated as (Advertised mAh / 1000) x 3.7V. A 30,000mAh bank is 111Wh. A 40,000mAh bank is 148Wh.\n\n**4. Input Speed (for recharging the power bank):**\nA large capacity power bank can take a long time to recharge. Look for one with a high-wattage USB-C Power Delivery input, like 65W. This allows you to use your laptop charger to refill the power bank in under 2 hours, instead of 8-10 hours.\n\n**5. The Cable:**\nYou cannot forget the cable. You must use a **USB-C to USB-C cable that is certified for 80W SuperVOOC charging**. A standard data cable or even a fast-charging PD cable may not work. Your safest bet is to use the cable that came with your 80W OnePlus wall charger or buy a replacement OnePlus/Oppo branded cable.\n\n---\n\n### 2: What's the max capacity, approximately, that is credible?\n\nHerein lies the challenge. The market for power banks is split:\n*   **SuperVOOC Power Banks:** Almost exclusively made by OnePlus/Oppo, and they top out at **10,000mAh**.\n*   **High-Capacity Power Banks (20,000mAh+):** Almost exclusively use the universal Power Delivery (PD) standard.\n\nTherefore, you cannot buy a single, credible, 30,000mAh power bank that will charge your Nord 3 at 80W. It does not exist.\n\nThe most credible maximum capacity for a single, portable, backpack-friendly unit from a reputable brand is **30,000mAh to 40,000mAh (111Wh to 148Wh)**. These are substantial, heavy bricks, but they are the peak of what's considered \"portable\" before moving into camping/solar generator territory.\n\n---\n\n### 3: Manufacturers and product names: 5 good options\n\nGiven the market reality, I will provide you with two types of options: ones that **prioritise speed** (but are low capacity) and ones that **prioritise capacity** (but won't charge at max 80W speed).\n\n#### **Category A: Prioritising MAXIMUM 80W SuperVOOC Speed**\n\nThese are the only options that will guarantee the fastest possible charge for your phone. You sacrifice significant capacity for speed.\n\n**1. OnePlus 10,000mAh 80W SuperVOOC Power Bank**\n*   **Manufacturer:** OnePlus\n*   **PN/Model:** PB102D\n*   **Why it's good:** This is the official solution. It's the only power bank guaranteed to deliver the full 80W SuperVOOC charge to your Nord 3. It's compact, high-quality, and has a useful little display showing remaining power. It also supports 45W PD for other devices.\n*   **The Catch:** The 10,000mAh capacity will only give you about 1.5 full charges for your 5000mAh phone.\n*   **RRP:** ~\u00a359.99 / $69.99\n\n**2. OPPO 10,000mAh SuperVOOC Power Bank**\n*   **Manufacturer:** OPPO\n*   **PN/Model:** CTA20 / BLP715\n*   **Why it's good:** Functionally identical to the OnePlus version (they are sister companies). It also delivers 80W SuperVOOC. Sometimes it can be found on sale for a bit less than the OnePlus branded version. It supports 33W PD output.\n*   **The Catch:** Same as the OnePlus - limited 10,000mAh capacity.\n*   **RRP:** ~\u00a354.99 / $59.99\n\n---\n\n#### **Category B: Prioritising MAXIMUM Capacity (but slower phone charging)**\n\nThese will give you the huge capacity you want, but your OnePlus Nord 3 will charge at a standard fast speed (around 18W-27W), not its maximum 80W. This is ideal for overnight charging or when you're away from a wall socket for days.\n\n**3. Ugreen 30000mAh 145W Power Bank (PB302)**\n*   **Manufacturer:** Ugreen\n*   **PN/Model:** PB302 (or newer equivalent)\n*   **Why it's good:** Ugreen is a highly reputable brand. This 30000mAh (111Wh) model is a beast. It has two high-powered USB-C ports (one 100W PD, one 45W PD) and two USB-A ports. You can charge multiple devices at once, and it recharges itself in 1.5 hours with a 65W+ charger. It's the perfect high-capacity workhorse.\n*   **The Catch:** Will not charge your Nord 3 at 80W SuperVOOC.\n*   **RRP:** ~\u00a399.99 / $119.99\n\n**4. Anker 737 PowerCore 26800mAh (PowerCore 24K)**\n*   **Manufacturer:** Anker\n*   **PN/Model:** A1286\n*   **Why it's good:** Anker is arguably the biggest name in power banks. This 26800mAh (99.2Wh) model features their latest GaNPrime technology for high efficiency. It has a 140W USB-C PD port, a 60W USB-C PD port, and two USB-A ports. The smart display is excellent for seeing input/output wattage in real-time. Build quality is second to none.\n*   **The Catch:** Will not charge your Nord 3 at 80W SuperVOOC.\n*   **RRP:** ~\u00a3149.99 / $149.99\n\n**5. Baseus 30000mAh 160W Power Bank**\n*   **Manufacturer:** Baseus\n*   **PN/Model:** PPBD030001 / PPBD030002 (check for latest model)\n*   **Why it's good:** Baseus offers incredible value and performance. This 30000mAh model often undercuts the competition on price while offering similar or even higher power output (160W). It features a large digital display and multiple ports, making it a versatile and very powerful choice.\n*   **The Catch:** Will not charge your Nord 3 at 80W SuperVOOC. Quality control can sometimes be a step below Anker/Ugreen, but they are generally very reliable.\n*   **RRP:** ~\u00a379.99 / $89.99\n\n---\n\n### **My Recommendation: The \"Best of Both Worlds\" Solution**\n\nYour request for \"max speed\" AND \"max capacity\" in one product is, unfortunately, impossible with the current market. Therefore, the most practical solution is to buy two devices:\n\n1.  **The OnePlus 10,000mAh 80W Power Bank** for when you need a rapid top-up and want to get from 0% to 50% in about 15 minutes.\n2.  **The Ugreen 30000mAh 145W Power Bank** for when you're going on a long trip, need to charge your phone multiple times over several days, or need to power other devices like a laptop or headphones.\n\nThis combo gives you the absolute best of both worlds and will cover you for every possible scenario.",
