  "response": "Of course. This is an excellent question because it highlights a common challenge: matching proprietary fast-charging technology with third-party accessories.\n\nLet's break it down for your OnePlus Nord 3 5G.\n\n### 1: Tech Spec: What You're Looking For\n\nYour primary challenge is the \"SuperVOOC\" charging standard. It's a proprietary technology from OPPO (OnePlus's parent company). To get the absolute maximum charging speed for your OnePlus Nord 3 (which is **80W SUPERVOOC**), you need a power bank and cable that explicitly support it.\n\nHere are the key parameters you need to look for, in order of importance for your specific needs:\n\n1.  **Charging Protocol Support (The Most Important Spec):**\n    *   **Ideal:** The power bank's specifications must explicitly list **\"SuperVOOC\"** or **\"VOOC\"** support. You are highly unlikely to find a third-party power bank that supports 80W SuperVOOC. The best you will find is likely 50W or 65W SuperVOOC, which will still be incredibly fast.\n    *   **The Next-Best Alternative:** If you can't find a SuperVOOC power bank, you need one with **USB Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 (or 3.1) with PPS (Programmable Power Supply)**. This is a universal fast-charging standard that your Nord 3 also supports, although it will charge at a slower (but still fast) rate than the full 80W SuperVOOC. A power bank with a 65W or 100W PD output will be more than sufficient.\n\n2.  **Output Wattage and Voltage/Amperage:**\n    *   For SuperVOOC, the power bank needs to deliver a specific voltage and amperage combination (e.g., 80W is achieved with 11V/7.3A). Only a licensed power bank can do this.\n    *   For the USB-PD alternative, look for a high total output, like **65W, 100W, or even 140W** from a single USB-C port. This ensures the bank can comfortably provide whatever maximum power the phone agrees to negotiate via the PD standard.\n\n3.  **Capacity (mAh and Wh):**\n    *   You're looking for something large. Capacity is measured in milliamp-hours (mAh) or Watt-hours (Wh). **Wh is the more accurate measure of total energy.**\n    *   Since you're ignoring airline limits (which are ~27,000mAh / 100Wh), you can look for power banks in the **30,000mAh to 50,000mAh** range. This is the upper limit for what is considered a \"portable power bank\" before it becomes a \"power station.\"\n\n4.  **The Right Cable:**\n    *   This is non-negotiable for SuperVOOC. You **must** use an official OnePlus (or OPPO) SuperVOOC cable (usually the thicker red/white one). A standard USB-C cable will not activate SuperVOOC speeds, even with the right power bank.\n\n5.  **Reputable Brands & Safety:**\n    *   To avoid fake capacity claims and ensure safety, stick to well-known, reputable brands. Good examples include **Anker, Ugreen, Baseus, Shargeek, and official brands like OPPO or Realme.** They have proper safety certifications (like CE, FCC, RoHS) and build their products to meet their advertised specs.\n\n---\n\n### 2: What's the Max Credible Capacity?\n\nFor a device that can still be reasonably called a \"power bank\" and fits in a backpack, the maximum credible capacity you'll find from a reputable manufacturer is around **40,000mAh to 50,000mAh**.\n\nAnything advertised significantly above this (e.g., 100,000mAh in a small brick) is almost certainly a scam with a much smaller, low-quality battery inside. A genuine 50,000mAh power bank is a hefty device, weighing over 1kg (2.2 lbs), and represents the practical peak of the portable market.\n\n---\n\n### 3: 5 Good Options (Manufacturer & Product Names)\n\nHere are five specific and excellent options that cater to your request, balancing speed and capacity.\n\n#### Option 1: The \"True Fast Charging\" Choice\n\n*   **Manufacturer/PN:** **OPPO 50W SuperVOOC Power Bank** (Model PBV02)\n*   **Key Specs:** 10,000mAh, **50W SuperVOOC Output**, USB-C and USB-A ports.\n*   **Approx. RRP:** ~$70 USD / \u00a360 / \u20ac65\n*   **Why it's a good choice:** This is one of the very few power banks on the market that officially supports the SuperVOOC protocol. While it's not the full 80W your phone can handle, 50W is still blisteringly fast\u2014far faster than any standard PD charge. **If your number one priority is getting the unique SuperVOOC speed, this is your best bet.** The trade-off is the lower 10,000mAh capacity.\n\n#### Option 2: The High-Tech, High-Power All-Rounder\n\n*   **Manufacturer/PN:** **Anker 737 Power Bank** (PowerCore 24K)\n*   **Key Specs:** 24,000mAh, **140W Max Output** (USB PD 3.1), Smart Digital Display.\n*   **Approx. RRP:** ~$150 USD / \u00a3130 / \u20ac140\n*   **Why it's a good choice:** This is arguably the gold standard for high-performance power banks. While it won't give you \"SuperVOOC,\" its 140W PD 3.1 output is cutting-edge. It will fast charge your Nord 3 via USB-PD at the highest possible non-SuperVOOC speed. Its 24,000mAh capacity is substantial, and it has the power to charge a MacBook Pro, making it incredibly versatile. The smart display is a genuinely useful feature for monitoring power.\n\n#### Option 3: The Best Value High-Power Competitor\n\n*   **Manufacturer/PN:** **Ugreen 145W Power Bank** (25000mAh)\n*   **Key Specs:** 25,000mAh, **145W Max Output** (100W from single USB-C), Digital Display.\n*   **Approx. RRP:** ~$130 USD / \u00a3110 / \u20ac120\n*   **Why it's a good choice:** Ugreen is a direct and highly respected competitor to Anker. This power bank offers very similar specs to the Anker 737\u2014high capacity and very high wattage\u2014often at a slightly more competitive price. It\u2019s a fantastic all-rounder that will charge your Nord 3 quickly via PD and handle all your other high-power devices.\n\n#### Option 4: The Large Capacity Workhorse\n\n*   **Manufacturer/PN:** **Baseus Amblight 65W Digital Display Power Bank** (30000mAh)\n*   **Key specs:** **30,000mAh**, **65W Max Output** (USB PD), 5 output ports, Digital Display.\n*   **Approx. RRP:** ~$80 USD / \u00a370 / \u20ac75\n*   **Why it's a good choice:** This power bank prioritizes massive capacity. At 30,000mAh, it holds enough energy to charge your Nord 3 (which has a 5,000mAh battery) about 4-5 times from empty. The 65W PD output is more than enough to fast-charge your phone and even power a compatible laptop. It's an excellent value for someone who wants the largest credible capacity without spending a premium.\n\n#### Option 5: The \"Cool Factor\" and High-Performance Choice\n\n*   **Manufacturer/PN:** **Shargeek Storm 2** (by SHARGE)\n*   **Key specs:** 25,600mAh, **100W Max Output** (USB PD), See-through design, On-screen display OS.\n*   **Approx. RRP:** ~$230 USD / \u00a3200 / \u20ac220\n*   **Why it's a good choice:** If you appreciate unique design and top-tier tech, the Storm 2 is iconic. It has a transparent \"cyberpunk\" case that lets you see the internal circuitry and batteries. More importantly, it's a stellar performer with 100W PD output and a large 25,600mAh capacity. Its detailed on-screen OS gives you more information than any other power bank. It's a premium, high-performance statement piece.",
