Here’s what you should look for when picking a power bank for your One Plus Nord 3 5G:

### **Tech Specs to Consider:**

1. **Output Power:** Ensure the power bank supports One Plus's SuperVOOC fast charging, which typically requires **65W or more output**. Check if the power bank has Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 and/or supports proprietary fast-charging standards.
2. **Capacity:** A larger capacity means more charges. Look for **20,000mAh to 40,000mAh**—higher capacities exist but may be bulkier.
3. **Cable Support:** Use a Type-C to Type-C cable rated for high-speed charging. Confirm that the power bank supports the **9V/3A, 12V/5A, or 20V/3.25A profiles** for maximum compatibility.
4. **Input Recharging Speed:** Check the time it takes to recharge the power bank. PD-enabled power banks often recharge in **1–2 hours** with appropriate chargers.

### **Maximum Credible Capacity:**

A **40,000mAh power bank** is realistic in the portable form factor. Some brands market higher capacities, but those push the limits of usability or veracity.

### **Top 5 Recommendations:**
