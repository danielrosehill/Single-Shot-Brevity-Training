OnePlus Nord 3 5G – what matters  
- 80 W SuperVOOC (10 V 8 A) is the fastest the phone will ever take.  
- To get that from a power bank you need:  
  – USB-C port that advertises 10 V/8 A SuperVOOC profile (very few do).  
  – A genuine 10 A-rated 6 A-10 A USB-C-to-C cable (OnePlus “80 W” or “100 W” red-logo cable is easiest).  
- 80 W in ≈ 4 000 mAh internal, so 25 000–30 000 mAh power-bank capacity gives roughly five full 0-100 % charges – that is the practical backpack-size ceiling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. TECH-SPEC CHECKLIST YOU SHOP WITH
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- USB-C PD 3.1 OR proprietary OnePlus 10 V/8 A.  
- Rated 80 W or higher on **ONE** port (not the sum of two ports).  
- Minimum 20 000 mAh / 74 Wh actual cell capacity (= headline 20 000 mAh; ≈ 12 000 mAh phone-usable).  
- Graphene or Li-poly pouch cells from a tier-one factory (ATL, Lishen, EVE, Ganfeng, BYD) – that is what keeps the weight believable and prevents the “40 000 mAh in 250 g” scam.  
- Power-bank can **INPUT** ≥ 65 W (so you can re-charge it overnight).  
- Ships with USB-C cable that is 6 A/10 A – if it does not, buy OnePlus 80 W red-logo cable (≈ $8).  
- Operating temperature 0-45 °C, 500 cycle 80 % capacity retention spec listed in the manual – if the brand does not quote it, skip it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CREDIBLE “BIGGEST IN A BACK-PACK” SIZE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Honest manufacturers stop at 8 × 3 500 mAh 18650 cells or 8 × 5 000 mAh flat pouch cells.  
That is 28 000 mAh / 100 Wh – coincidentally the US FAA limit, but you are not flying.  
Anything advertised above 30 000 mAh in a single hand-held block (≤ 600 g) is almost always fiction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. FIVE SPECIFIC POWER BANKS THAT GIVE 80 W SUPERVOOC + 20 k–28 k mAh
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prices are the 2024 recommended retail / launch price – street prices are 10-20 % lower.

1. OnePlus SUPERVOOC 80 W Power Bank  
   P/N: PBLB03 / PB002  
   25 000 mAh (92 Wh) – single USB-C 80 W VOOC, 45 W re-charge.  
   RRP: ₹4 999 / US $69.

2. Realme 80 W SuperDart Power Bank (identical electronics, red VOOC badge)  
   P/N: RMP2000  
   25 000 mAh (92 Wh) – 80 W VOOC, 45 W re-charge.  
   RRP: ₹4 499 / US $65.

3. Oppo 80 W Flash Charge Power Bank  
   P/N: PBM003  
   25 000 mAh (92 Wh) – 80 W VOOC, 45 W re-charge.  
   RRP: ¥399 / US $69 (China), ₹4 999 (India).

4. Anker 548 LiFePO₄ 27 650 60 W – NOT VOOC but highest honest density  
   P/N: A1361  
   27 650 60 W (24 000 mAh @ 3.2 V → 76 Wh) – you still get ≈ 50 W on Nord 3.  
   I list it only because it is the largest credible capacity you can presently buy that is < 600 g.  
   RRP: US $149.

5. Baseus BPE20 65 W PD 20 000 mAh (semi-polymer) – best if you cannot find the three VOOC models above.  
   P/N: BPP-B20 65W  
   20 000 mAh (74 Wh) – 65 W USB-C PD, will “fast-charge” Nord 3 at 28 W; not 80 W but honest spec.  
   RRP: US $59 / €59.

Bottom line: buy the OnePlus, Realme or Oppo 25 000 mAh 80 W VOOC unit (same hardware, different badge). It is the biggest capacity that is both real and fully exploits your phone’s 80 W SuperVOOC indoors or in a backpack.
