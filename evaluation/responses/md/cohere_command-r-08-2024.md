Certainly, let's ensure you get the right power bank for your needs! 

1. Tech Specs: 

To achieve fast charging for your One Plus Nord 3 5G, you'll want to look for a power bank that supports the SuperVOOC (Super Voltage Optimized Charging) standard. SuperVOOC is a technology developed by OPPO (which is closely associated with OnePlus) to offer incredibly fast charging speeds. It delivers up to 65W of power, enabling rapid charging of compatible devices. 

Therefore, the key parameters to look out for are:
- Power Output: Look for a power bank that can deliver a high power output of at least 65W. 
- Ports and Compatibility: Ensure the power bank has a compatible port (USB-C) that supports the SuperVOOC standard. Some power banks may be labeled as supporting 'OPPO Dart Charge' which is essentially the same as SuperVOOC. 
- Battery Capacity: As you want the largest capacity, opt for a power bank with a high mAh (milliamp-hour) rating. 

2. Max Capacity Credibility: 

Reputable power banks with large capacities typically have a battery capacity of around 20,000 - 25,000 mAh. While there are power banks with even higher capacity ratings available, it's crucial to strike a balance between battery life and the overall weight and size of the power bank for portability.
