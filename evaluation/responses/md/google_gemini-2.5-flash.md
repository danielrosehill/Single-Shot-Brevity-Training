That's a great request! The OnePlus Nord 3 5G is a fantastic phone, and maximizing its charging speed with a power bank is a smart move. Let's break down how to get you set up with a powerful and reliable power bank.

## 1: Tech Specs: What Am I Looking For?

To charge your OnePlus Nord 3 5G as quickly as possible and get a large, credible capacity, here's what you need to prioritize in a power bank:

*   **Charging Protocol Compatibility (Crucial!):** This is the most important factor for fast charging your Nord 3.
    *   **SuperVOOC/VOOC/Dart Charge/Warp Charge:** OnePlus uses its proprietary SuperVOOC technology (and its predecessors like VOOC, Dart, and Warp Charge). To get the absolute fastest charging speed, you need a power bank that *explicitly supports SuperVOOC*. Some power banks might just say "VOOC" or "Dart," which will still be much faster than generic USB PD, but "SuperVOOC" is the latest and greatest.
    *   **USB Power Delivery (USB-PD):** While SuperVOOC is ideal, if a power bank doesn't support it, the next best thing is a strong USB-PD output. The Nord 3 5G supports up to **80W SuperVOOC**. For USB-PD, it will likely fall back to around 18W-30W, which is still decent but not nearly as fast as SuperVOOC. Many good power banks offer both, with the SuperVOOC port specifically for OnePlus/Oppo/Realme devices.
    *   **Output Wattage for SuperVOOC:** Look for a power bank that specifies an output of **65W-80W** for SuperVOOC. While your phone can take 80W, finding a power bank that outputs exactly 80W via SuperVOOC might be tricky. Many will top out at 65W, which is still incredibly fast.
*   **Output Ports:**
    *   **USB-A Port (with SuperVOOC/VOOC support):** This is typically the port that will deliver the proprietary SuperVOOC charging. Ensure it specifies the high wattage (e.g., 65W SuperVOOC).
    *   **USB-C Port (with USB-PD):** Most modern high-capacity power banks will have at least one USB-C port that supports Power Delivery for charging other devices or even the power bank itself. While it won't give you SuperVOOC, it's good to have for versatility and for charging the power bank quickly. Ensure this port can output at least 45W-65W for laptop charging, etc.
*   **Input Wattage (for Recharging the Power Bank):** To recharge a large capacity power bank in a reasonable amount of time, you'll want a fast input. Look for USB-C PD input of at least **45W-65W**.
*   **Capacity:** Measured in milliampere-hours (mAh). See the next section for credible limits.
*   **Safety Features:** Overcharge protection, over-discharge protection, short-circuit protection, over-current protection, temperature protection. Reputable brands will always include these.
*   **Pass-Through Charging (Optional but nice):** Ability to charge the phone while the power bank itself is being charged.

**In summary, for peak performance on your Nord 3 5G, you're primarily looking for a power bank with at least one USB-A output port explicitly supporting 65W SuperVOOC (or VOOC/Dart/Warp Charge if SuperVOOC is not specified).**

## 2: Max Credible Capacity (Portable Form Factor)

For a power bank that can be slotted into a backpack, is genuinely portable, and offers a credible capacity from a reputable manufacturer, the maximum credible capacity you'll typically find is around **20,000 mAh to 27,000 mAh (or 100Wh, Watt-hours)**.

*   **Why 27,000 mAh?** This capacity (at 3.7V nominal battery voltage) is approximately equivalent to 99.9 Wh. The 100 Wh limit is a common aviation restriction for carry-on luggage (though you're not traveling, manufacturers often design around this for broad appeal). Beyond this, power banks tend to get significantly larger, heavier, and step into the "power station" territory rather than "power bank."
*   **Claims beyond 30,000 mAh from unknown brands are highly suspect.** While technologically possible, fitting more than 27,000 mAh into a truly portable, backpack-friendly form factor from a reputable brand without becoming prohibitively expensive or bulky is rare.
*   **Real-world capacity vs. stated capacity:** Remember that due to voltage conversion losses, the "usable" capacity will always be slightly less than the stated capacity. A 20,000 mAh power bank might deliver closer to 13,000-15,000 mAh to your phone, but it's still a significant amount of charge.

So, target **20,000 mAh to 27,000 mAh** for the sweet spot of capacity and portability from a reliable brand.

## 3: Manufacturers and Product Names (5 Good Options)

Finding power banks that explicitly state "SuperVOOC" support outside of OnePlus's own ecosystem can be a bit challenging, as it's a proprietary technology. However, some brands have licensed it or offer compatibility under other names (VOOC, Dart). The best bets will be from brands closely associated with Oppo/Realme/OnePlus or brands known for high-speed proprietary charging.

**Important Note on Pricing:** RRP (Recommended Retail Price) can fluctuate wildly based on region, sales, and retailer. The prices below are *estimates* and should be used as a guideline. Always check current pricing from reputable retailers.

Here are 5 good options, focusing on SuperVOOC/VOOC compatibility where possible, or excellent USB-PD if SuperVOOC isn't available:

---

1.  **OnePlus Power Bank 10000 mAh (18W/20W VOOC/PD)**
    *   **Why it's a fit:** This is the *safest* bet for guaranteed compatibility with VOOC/SuperVOOC (though usually at a lower wattage than your phone's max). While it's only 10,000 mAh, it's from OnePlus itself, so you know the charging tech will handshake perfectly. **However, it won't hit 65W-80W SuperVOOC.** It typically supports 18W/20W VOOC/PD. I'm including it as the *most compatible* even if it doesn't meet your "as fast as possible" requirement fully for SuperVOOC.
    *   **Tech Specs:**
        *   Capacity: 10,000 mAh
        *   Output: 18W/20W Power Delivery (USB-C), 18W/20W VOOC/PD (USB-A)
        *   Input: 18W/20W PD (USB-C)
    *   **RRP (Estimate):** $30 - $40 USD
    *   **Note:** While it charges well, it won't utilize your Nord 3's full 80W SuperVOOC potential. It's listed mainly for brand compatibility.

2.  **Baseus Blade Laptop Power Bank (or similar Baseus models with VOOC support)**
    *   **Why it's a fit:** Baseus is known for making power banks with a wide range of fast-charging protocols, *including* VOOC/Dart Charge/SuperVOOC compatibility on some models. You need to verify the specific model's specs. Many of their high-capacity models prioritize USB-PD, but some dedicate a USB-A port for Oppo/OnePlus. Look for models explicitly stating "VOOC," "Dart," or "SuperVOOC" up to 65W.
    *   **Example (Blade series or similar):**
        *   Capacity: 20,000 mAh or 24,000 mAh
        *   Output: Often includes 65W/100W USB-C PD, and a USB-A port that might support 30W-65W VOOC/Dart. *Crucially, check the specific model's detailed specs for VOOC/SuperVOOC support via USB-A.*
        *   Input: 60W-65W USB-C PD
    *   **RRP (Estimate):** $70 - $120 USD (depending on capacity and wattage)

3.  **Realme Power Bank 30W Dart Charge (or similar Dart/VOOC compatible)**
    *   **Why it's a fit:** Realme is part of the same BBK Electronics family as OnePlus and Oppo, meaning their "Dart Charge" is essentially the same technology as VOOC/SuperVOOC. A Realme power bank with Dart Charge support will work very well with your Nord 3, though likely capped at 30W, not 65W-80W.
    *   **Tech Specs (example):**
        *   Capacity: 10,000 mAh or 20,000 mAh
        *   Output: 30W Dart/VOOC (USB-A), 18W PD (USB-C)
        *   Input: 30W PD (USB-C)
    *   **RRP (Estimate):** $40 - $60 USD
    *   **Note:** Similar to the OnePlus bank, this provides guaranteed compatibility but likely not at the Nord 3's maximum 80W SuperVOOC rate.

4.  **Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)**
    *   **Why it's a fit:** While Anker typically focuses on USB-PD and their own PowerIQ, this is an excellent, extremely high-quality power bank with massive capacity and very high USB-PD output. **It will NOT support SuperVOOC.** However, it will provide very fast USB-PD charging (up to 65W or more from its USB-C ports), which is the next best thing if a dedicated SuperVOOC bank isn't available or if you need to charge other devices like laptops. Your Nord 3 will negotiate the highest possible USB-PD rate.
    *   **Tech Specs:**
        *   Capacity: 24,000 mAh / 86.4Wh
        *   Output: 2x USB-C (up to 140W total, 100W single port), 1x USB-A (up to 18W)
        *   Input: 140W USB-C PD
    *   **RRP (Estimate):** $120 - $160 USD
    *   **Note:** Best in class for USB-PD, but lacks proprietary SuperVOOC. It will still charge your phone quickly via PD, just not at the absolute maximum 80W SuperVOOC speed.

5.  **Shargeek Storm2 Slim / Storm2 (or other high-end models with broad protocol support)**
    *   **Why it's a fit:** Shargeek (formerly Sharge) makes some of the most advanced power banks, often featuring wide protocol support and transparent designs. Like Baseus, some of their models specifically mention compatibility with legacy fast charging protocols for Oppo/OnePlus. You need to meticulously check the specs for the specific model.
    *   **Example (Storm2 Slim):**
        *   Capacity: 20,000 mAh / 72Wh
        *   Output: 1x USB-C (100W PD), 1x USB-A (30W with various protocols, *check for VOOC/Dart*).
        *   Input: 65W USB-C PD
    *   **RRP (Estimate):** $150 - $200 USD (for the Storm2 Slim; the regular Storm2 is even pricier)
    *   **Note:** Premium price for premium features and unique design. Again, verify the specific USB-A port's protocol compatibility before purchase.

**Crucial Recommendation:**

When you select a specific product, **ALWAYS double-check the detailed product specifications on the manufacturer's official website or a reputable retailer for explicit mention of "SuperVOOC," "VOOC," or "Dart Charge" support *and* the wattage associated with it on a specific port (usually USB-A)**. If it only says "fast charging" or "QC 3.0," it won't be as fast as dedicated SuperVOOC.

For the **cable**, make sure you use a **high-quality USB-A to USB-C cable that supports high wattage (up to 65W-80W)**. Ideally, use the original cable that came with your OnePlus Nord 3 5G, or a certified Warp/VOOC/SuperVOOC compatible cable from OnePlus or a reputable third-party.

Good luck with your power bank hunt!
