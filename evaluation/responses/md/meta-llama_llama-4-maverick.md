## Power Bank Requirements for OnePlus Nord 3 5G

To find a suitable power bank for your OnePlus Nord 3 5G, we'll break down the requirements into technical specifications, maximum credible capacity, and recommendations for manufacturers and product names.

### 1. Tech Spec: What Parameters Do You Need?

To charge your OnePlus Nord 3 5G as quickly as possible, you'll need a power bank that supports fast charging. Here are the key parameters to look for:

* **Output Voltage and Current:** The OnePlus Nord 3 5G supports SuperVOOC (also known as 80W SUPERVOOC) or more specifically, its variant 33W/67W/80W charging. To match this, you'll need a power bank with an output voltage of 5V, 9V, or 11V (or other voltages supported by the phone's fast charging protocol) and a high output current, preferably above 5A.
* **Power Delivery (PD) and Other Fast Charging Protocols:** While your phone supports SuperVOOC, a power bank with Power Delivery (PD) or other fast charging protocols like Quick Charge (QC) can still be useful, as many power banks support multiple protocols.
* **Capacity:** A high capacity is required to meet your second requirement.

### 2. Maximum Credible Capacity

For a portable power bank (not necessarily pocket-sized but something that can fit into a backpack), a credible maximum capacity is around 20,000mAh to 30,000mAh. Capacities above 30,000mAh may be less credible or may result in a larger form factor that's less portable.

### 3. Manufacturers and Product Names

Here are five good options with their Recommended Retail Price (RRP):

1. **Anker PowerCore Fusion 30,000mAh** (~ $79-$99)
   - Supports up to 60W PD output and has a large capacity.

2. **UGreen 25,000mAh 145W Power Bank** (~ $60-$80)
   - Supports high-speed charging with 145W output and has a large capacity.

3. **Mophie Powerstation XXL 20,000mAh** (~ $100-$130)
   - Known for its compact design despite the large capacity and supports up to 18W PD output.

4. **Jackery Titan S 30,000mAh** (~ $70-$90)
   - Offers a large capacity and supports fast charging.

5. **Baseus 30,000mAh 65W Power Bank** (~ $50-$70)
   - Supports 65W output and has a large capacity, a good balance of performance and price.

When choosing a power bank, ensure it supports the required fast charging protocols and has a credible capacity. Be aware that prices can vary based on region and retailer. Always check reviews and product specifications to ensure they meet your needs.
