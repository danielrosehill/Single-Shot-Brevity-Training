# Power Bank Recommendations for OnePlus Nord 3 5G

## 1. Tech Specs You Need

**Charging Speed:**
- **SuperVOOC 80W** support (Nord 3 5G supports 80W charging)
- Look for USB-C output with **PD (Power Delivery) 65W minimum** or proprietary VOOC/SuperVOOC protocol
- Reality check: Most third-party power banks won't replicate full 80W SuperVOOC, but 65W PD will charge very fast

**Capacity:**
- **25,000-27,000 mAh** is the sweet spot for maximum credible capacity in portable form
- This translates to approximately **90-100Wh** (airline limit is 100Wh, which helps verify legitimacy)
- Anything claiming 50,000+ mAh at portable size is likely fake/exaggerated

**Other specs to verify:**
- Reputable battery cells (LG, Samsung, or explicitly stated quality cells)
- Multiple certifications (UL, CE, FCC, RoHS)
- Clear Wh rating printed on device

## 2. Maximum Credible Capacity

**27,000 mAh / ~100Wh** is the realistic maximum for:
- Legitimate manufacturers
- Truly portable form factor (roughly smartphone-sized, 500-600g weight)
- Won't be pocket-sized but easily backpack-portable

## 3. Five Specific Product Recommendations

### 1. **Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)**
- **Model:** A1289

### 3. **Baseus Blade 100W Power Bank**

- **Notes:** Transparent design, premium feel, great tech specs

## Important Notes:

- **Cable matters:** Use a quality USB-C to USB-C cable rated for 100W+ to avoid bottlenecking
- **Native SuperVOOC:** Only official OnePlus power banks guarantee full 80W SuperVOOC, but they typically have smaller capacities (~10,000 mAh)
- **Real-world performance:** A 65W PD power bank will charge your Nord 3 to 80% in roughly 30-35 minutes vs 25 minutes with native 80W

**My top pick for your needs:** UGREEN PB205 or Anker 737 - both offer maximum credible capacity with fast charging from reputable manufacturers.
