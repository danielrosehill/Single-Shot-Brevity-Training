Short answer first:
- You’ll only get near-OnePlus “fast” speeds from a power bank that supports OPPO/OnePlus VOOC/SUPERVOOC (or realme Dart/SuperDart). Most mainstream PD banks will charge your Nord 3 much slower.
- The Nord 3’s in-box wired spec is 80W SUPERVOOC. The best widely available VOOC-compatible power banks top out around 50–65W, so you’ll get “fast” but not full 80W from a bank.
- If you want very large capacity, you’ll likely be using a high-quality USB PD power bank (not VOOC), which will charge your Nord 3 at a reduced rate (typically 18–27W, sometimes ~45W if the handset’s PD support allows).

1) What tech spec to look for
- Fast-charge protocol:
  - Ideal: Explicit VOOC/SUPERVOOC/Dart/SuperDart support, with outputs like 10V/6.5A or 11V/6–7A. That’s what unlocks “OnePlus-fast” speeds from a bank.
  - Otherwise: USB Power Delivery (PD 3.0/3.1) with PPS. Your Nord 3 will then charge at a reduced PD rate (expect 18–27W; some OnePlus models do up to ~45W PD, but not the full 80W).
- Cable: Use an original/genuine OPPO/OnePlus/realme VOOC/SUPERVOOC cable (rated 6.5A). Without the right cable, VOOC banks will fall back to slower modes.
- Capacity/energy:
  - Prioritize Watt-hours (Wh), not just mAh. Credible banks disclose Wh (mAh ratings are at 3.6–3.7V cell voltage, not at 5V output).
  - For reference: 10,000mAh ≈ 37Wh; 20,000mAh ≈ 74Wh; 30,000mAh ≈ 111Wh; 50,000mAh ≈ 185Wh.
- Output power:
  - Per-port and total output in watts.
  - For VOOC, look for at least 50W VOOC/Dart. For PD-only banks, 45–140W PD is fine for future devices and fast self‑recharge.
- Input (self-charging) speed: Prefer 45–100W PD input so the bank refills quickly.
- Cells and safety: High-quality cells (often 21700), rated cycle life ≥500, with proper protections (OTP, OVP, SCP). Reputable brands publish certification (CE/FCC/UKCA/PSE).

2) Max credible capacity (backpackable)
- Realistic, reputable “power bank” ceiling: about 30,000–50,000mAh (≈111–185Wh). Above this you’re into heavy bricks or “power station” territory.
- Weight check: ~30,000mAh is ~600–800g; ~50,000mAh is ~1.0–1.3kg. Anything claiming 60,000–100,000mAh in a small case is usually overstated or measures at 3.7V but implies 5V.
- Practical estimate for your Nord 3 (≈5000mAh battery):
  - 20,000mAh bank: ~2.5–3 full charges (after conversion losses).
  - 30,000mAh bank: ~4–5 charges.
  - 50,000mAh bank: ~7–8+ charges.

3) Specific product options (fastest with VOOC vs biggest capacity with PD)
Note: Availability and model codes can vary by region; RRPs/MSRPs shown are typical at launch.

A) VOOC/SUPERVOOC-compatible (for the fastest possible charging on OnePlus)
1) realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart Power Bank
- Manufacturer: realme
- Model name: realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart Power Bank (regional SKUs vary)
- Output: Up to 50W SuperDart/VOOC on USB-A; USB-C PD up to 45–50W (2‑way fast charge)
- RRP (India at launch): ~INR 3,499
- Why: One of the rare banks that actually speaks VOOC-family fast charge, typically delivering 50W-class charging to OnePlus/OPPO/realme phones.

2) OnePlus 10000mAh 33W Power Bank
- Manufacturer: OnePlus
- Model name: OnePlus 10,000mAh 33W Power Bank (regional SKU varies)
- Output: Up to 33W Warp/SUPERVOOC on USB-A; PD on USB-C
- RRP (India at launch): ~INR 2,299
- Why: Genuine OnePlus accessory; while it won’t hit 80W, it provides proprietary fast charging above standard PD levels.

3) OPPO 10000mAh 33W VOOC Flash Charge Power Bank (Power Bank 2)
- Manufacturer: OPPO
- Model name: OPPO 10,000mAh VOOC Power Bank (33W version; regional SKU varies)
- Output: VOOC up to 33W; PD on USB-C
- RRP (China at launch): ~CNY 199–249
- Why: VOOC-backed bank from OPPO; compatible with OnePlus fast-charge family, faster than PD on OnePlus.

Notes on VOOC banks:
- They’re typically limited to 10,000mAh. If you need both VOOC speed and big capacity, you may need to carry two, or accept PD speed for a big single bank.

B) High-capacity, reputable PD/PPS banks (maximum credible capacity; will charge your Nord 3 at its PD rate, not SUPERVOOC)
4) Anker 347 Power Bank (PowerCore 40K)
- Manufacturer: Anker
- Part number: A1379 (PowerCore 40K)
- Capacity: 40,000mAh (≈148Wh)
- Output: Up to 30W USB‑C PD (multiple ports)
- MSRP (US): ~$99.99
- Why: Very large, credible capacity from a top-tier brand; rock-solid cell quality and protections. Expect your Nord 3 to charge at its PD rate (not VOOC).

5) Anker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K)
- Manufacturer: Anker
- Part number: A1289
- Capacity: 24,000mAh (≈86.4Wh)
- Output: Up to 140W USB‑C PD 3.1 (great for laptops), fast 100W PD input to refill the bank
- MSRP (US): ~$159.99
- Why: Extremely fast PD for broader use and very fast self‑recharge; while your Nord 3 will charge at its PD ceiling only, this is a versatile, premium pick.

If you want one “big but still premium” PD bank with higher output than the 40K Anker, consider:
- UGREEN 145W 25,000mAh Power Bank (model varies by region, often listed as 145W/25,000mAh). MSRP ~US$149.99. Excellent PD/PPS support and quick self‑recharge. Again, your Nord 3 will charge at PD rate.

Buying/verification tips
- Check the energy rating (Wh) on the spec label or datasheet; compare weight to sanity‑check capacity.
- For OnePlus‑fast charging: confirm the product explicitly lists VOOC/Dart/SUPERVOOC, not just “33W/45W” without protocol detail.
- Use an original OPPO/OnePlus/realme 6.5A cable for VOOC/SUPERVOOC results.
- For large PD banks, prefer brands that publish PD/PPS profiles (e.g., 5–11V PPS ranges) and input wattage so you can refill quickly with a capable wall charger.

Quick recommendations by priority
- Fastest possible on your Nord 3: realme 10000mAh 50W SuperDart PB (carry two if you want more total energy).
- Biggest credible single bank: Anker 347 PowerCore 40K (huge capacity; charges Nord 3 at PD speed).
- Best all‑round premium PD: Anker 737 PowerCore 24K (top PD performance; great if you also charge laptops).
