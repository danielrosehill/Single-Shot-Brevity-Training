# Repository Setup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Organization

The repository has been reorganized with a clear, logical structure:

```

│   ├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
│   └── README.md             # Evaluation documentation
│
└── docs/                      # Project documentation
    ├── project-rationale.md   # Why this matters
    ├── model-selection.md     # 10 models chosen and rationale
    ├── usage-guide.md         # Step-by-step usage instructions
    └── SETUP_SUMMARY.md       # This file
```

### 2. Files Created

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project overview
- `docs/model-selection.md` - 10 selected models with rationale
- `docs/project-rationale.md` - Moved from notes.md
- `docs/usage-guide.md` - Step-by-step usage instructions
- `evaluation/README.md` - Evaluation framework documentation

**Code:**
- `evaluation/scripts/evaluate_models.py` - Full evaluation script
- `evaluation/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

**Configuration:**
- `.gitignore` - Proper ignore rules for Python, envs, results

**Data Organization:**
- Moved test prompt to `prompts/`
- Moved response examples to `data/`
- Created empty `system-prompts/` for future work

### 3. Model Selection

10 models chosen for evaluation across multiple providers:

| Model | Provider | Why Selected |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Anthropic | Balanced, professional baseline |
| Claude 3 Haiku | Anthropic | Designed for brevity/efficiency |
| GPT-4o | OpenAI | Latest GPT variant |
| GPT-4o Mini | OpenAI | Faster, more concise |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | Google | Fast inference |
| Llama 3.3 70B Instruct | Meta | Open source baseline |
| Mistral Large | Mistral | Known for directness |
| DeepSeek V3 | DeepSeek | Efficient reasoning |
| Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct | Qwen | Strong instruction following |
| Command R+ | Cohere | Business-focused |

### 4. Evaluation Script Features

The `evaluate_models.py` script:

**Functionality:**
- Loads test prompt automatically
- Calls all 10 models via OpenRouter API
- Handles rate limiting and retries
- Saves individual and aggregated results
- Provides brevity ranking

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Word count (primary brevity metric)
- Character count
- Line count
- Presence of formatting (bullets, tables, headers)
- Token usage and costs

**Output:**
- Timestamped result directories
- JSON files with full structured data
- Markdown files with readable responses
- Summary with brevity rankings

## What's Ready to Use

### Immediately Available:
1. Run evaluation against 10 models
2. Compare baseline brevity characteristics
3. Identify best model for your use case

### Next Steps (Phase 2):
1. Review evaluation results
2. Select best baseline model
3. Create single-shot training system prompt
4. Test effectiveness of single-shot approach

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites:
```bash
# 1. Python 3.8+
python --version

# 2. OpenRouter API key
# Sign up at https://openrouter.ai/
# Add ~$5-10 in credits
```

### Quick Start:
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r evaluation/requirements.txt

# 2. Set API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# 3. Run evaluation
python evaluation/scripts/evaluate_models.py

# 4. Review results
ls -lh evaluation/results/*/
```

### Expected Runtime:
- ~2-5 minutes total
- ~10-30 seconds per model
- 2 second delay between requests (rate limiting)

### Expected Costs:
- Small models: ~$0.01-0.05 each
- Large models: ~$0.10-0.25 each
- Total per run: ~$1-2

## Documentation

All documentation is comprehensive and ready:

1. **README.md** - Project overview, quick start
2. **evaluation/README.md** - Evaluation framework details
3. **docs/model-selection.md** - Why these 10 models
4. **docs/project-rationale.md** - Problem and approach
5. **docs/usage-guide.md** - Step-by-step instructions

## Git Status

Repository is ready to commit:
- All files organized
- Documentation complete
- Evaluation framework ready
- `.gitignore` configured
- Results directory will be ignored

### Suggested Commit Message:
```
feat: initial repository setup with evaluation framework

- Reorganized repository structure
- Created evaluation framework for 10 LLM models
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Implemented brevity analysis metrics
- Ready for baseline model evaluation

Models tested: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Cohere
```

## What Makes This Unique

1. **Systematic approach**: Not just testing verbosity, but finding the optimal balance
2. **Diverse model selection**: Multiple providers, sizes, architectures
3. **Real-world test case**: Actual useful prompt, not artificial
4. **Two-phase strategy**: Find best baseline, then optimize with single-shot training
5. **Reproducible**: Clear documentation, version controlled, open methodology
6. **Practical**: Solves real problem of overly verbose AI responses

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Additional test prompts for different domains
- Automated quality scoring beyond just word count
- Comparison with fine-tuning approaches
- Analysis of response accuracy vs brevity trade-offs
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Integration with other evaluation frameworks
