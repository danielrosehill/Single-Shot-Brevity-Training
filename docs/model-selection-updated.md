## Selection Rationale

This expanded selection provides:

### Provider Diversity
- Western: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cohere, Meta, Mistral, xAI, AI21
- Chinese: DeepSeek, GLM, Moonshot, Yi, Qwen
- Mix of commercial and open source

### Size Diversity
- Large flagship models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- Medium efficient models (Gemini Flash, Command R)
- Smaller specialized models (Yi 34B, Qwen 32B)

### Architecture Diversity
- Standard transformers (most models)
- Hybrid architectures (Jamba with SSM-Transformer)
- Efficiency-optimized (Gemini Flash, DeepSeek)
- Multimodal (Qwen VL, Gemini)

### Use Case Focus
- General purpose (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini Pro)
- Business/RAG (Cohere models)
- Technical (Mistral, DeepSeek)
- Real-time info (Grok)

## Expected Outcomes

### Most Likely to Be Concise
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash (designed for speed/efficiency)
2. Mistral Large 2411 (known for directness)
3. DeepSeek Chat v3.1 (efficient architecture)
4. Grok 4 (direct communication style)

### Most Likely to Be Verbose
1. GPT-5 (comprehensive by default)
2. Command R+ (designed for thoroughness)
3. Gemini 2.5 Pro (flagship with detailed outputs)
4. Jamba Large (comprehensive due to size)

### Wild Cards
1. Claude Sonnet 4.5 (balanced, context-dependent)
2. Kimi K2 (varies with task)
3. Qwen3 VL (multimodal may affect verbosity)
4. GPT OSS 120B (community-trained, unpredictable)

### Cultural Differences
Interesting to compare:
- Western models (tend toward conversational explanations)
- Chinese models (often more direct/structured)
- Open source vs commercial (training philosophy differences)

## Evaluation Metrics

Each response will be scored on:

### Quantitative
- Word count (primary brevity metric)
- Character count
- Line count
- Token usage
- Response time

### Qualitative
- Answers all 3 questions?
- Accurate information?
- Unnecessary elaboration?
- Structure and formatting
- Helpful vs distracting context

## Running the Evaluation

Total models: **17**
Estimated time: **5-10 minutes**
Estimated cost: **$3-5** (varies by model pricing)

With 2-second delays between requests for rate limiting.

## Next Steps

1. Run evaluation script
2. Analyze results across dimensions:
   - Brevity (word count)
   - Accuracy (correct answers)
   - Structure (formatting quality)
   - Cultural patterns (Western vs Chinese models)
   - Architecture impact (hybrid vs standard)
3. Identify best baseline model
4. Test single-shot training approach
5. Document findings

## Future Expansions

Potential additions:
- More open source models
- Smaller efficient models (sub-10B)
- Domain-specific models (code, science)
- Different prompt types (technical, creative, analytical)
