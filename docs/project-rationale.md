# Why This Test Prompt

I chose this prompt because it represents a very mundane example of a prompt that (when it works) has been a game-changer for me: rather than sift through pages of SERPs (and dubiously accurate and often vendor sponsored affiliate marketing), I provide a detailed description of what I need and hope to get back very precise product recommendations.

The first time I trusted AI to guide me on a $100+ purchase (ie, non-trivial) was a turning point (that purchase was an ergonomic vertical mouse and it's among the best things I've ever bought!)

Equally:

It's exactly the type of prompt that's liable to encourage an LLM to take on the role of "unsolicited professor." 

As I write this (on a Monday morning), I'm not particularly in the mood for a lesson on how watt-hours are calculated. And actually, I was aware that output and capacity are two different things. I want a short, snappy but accurate response.

## Defining Requirements

Prompts like this also have more than meets the eye. 

Consumer electronics evolves constantly - as to product numbers. To be in any way useful, an AI response to this prompt ideally needs to leverage web search (so that the products it can think of are on the market and available in my geography). And speaking of geography (I live in Israel!), this morsel of context is also relevant: it needs to know this for shipping and customs and marketplace selection.

We could go further: MCPs for Amazon and Aliexpress srapers would be helpful too. But a good LLM, a short system prompt, and web search are enough.
